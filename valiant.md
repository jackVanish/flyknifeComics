**What was the first story you were ever told?**

**What was the first legend you ever heard?**

**What was the first dream you ever had?**

**I will tell you of a time of valour.**

**Of angels and demons.**

**Of battles beyond all imagining.**

So begins _The Valiant Stars_, and so begins an adventure that thirty years of discerning sci-fi fans have treasured above all others! 

Ever since Flyknife Comics acquired the license for Laughing Lizard's wide range of properties, we have been committed to making these astounding tales of adventure and derring-do accessible for readers from across all generations. _The Valiant Stars_ possesses a famously dense cast of characters (numbering between 400 and 1000, by some counts), and as such, new readers, viewers, video-gamers, and afficionados of Multimedia Alternate Reality Game Experiences (MARGE-Heads) have found the story difficult to get into. As the availability of different media degrades, licenses change hands, pirate servers are microwave-bombarded from orbit by the BINARY ORDER, and undocumented, disputed-canon entries in the series are recovered from the Citadel of Tales by enterprising ruin hounds, the problem becomes only more potent. But no longer! Flyknife Comics, partnering with a splinter faction of heretical Record Knights from the Citadel of Tales, have created this reference guide to help you get started in this exhilarating world of high adventure and savage danger!

In here, you'll find recaps of each of the books, as published. You'll also find that the characters' names link to handy datacards that tell you who they are, what they've done, and which books they've shown up in. Diving into the world of _The Valiant Stars_ has never been easier!

**A Note For New Readers**: While this resource may be useful as you work your way through the story, please note that it does contain **unmarked spoilers** for each book, and is written with the assumption that you have read all but the latest published book. At the current time, that is _Starbreakers -- Gunstar Runaways of the Rebel Sky Volume 2: Hypergalactic Fury Upon the Night_. We therefore recommend that if this is your first encounter with _The Valiant Stars_, you read the stories in chronological order, as they are presented in the [Librarium](/librarium).
