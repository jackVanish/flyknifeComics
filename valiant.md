**What was the first story you were ever told?**

**What was the first legend you ever heard?**

**What was the first dream you ever had?**

**I will tell you of a time of valour.**

**Of angels and demons.**

**Of battles beyond all imagining.**

So begins _The Valiant Stars_, and so begins an adventure that thirty years of discerning sci-fi fans have treasured above all others! 

Ever since Flyknife Comics acquired the license for Laughing Lizard's wide range of properties, we have been committed to making these astounding tales of adventure and derring-do accessible for readers from across all generations. _The Valiant Stars_ possesses a famously dense cast of characters (numbering between 400 and 1000, by some counts), and as such, new readers, viewers, video-gamers, and afficionados of Multimedia Alternate Reality Game Experiences (MARGE-Heads) have found the story difficult to get into. As the availability of different media degrades, licenses change hands, pirate servers are microwave-bombarded from orbit by the BINARY ORDER, and undocumented, disputed-canon entries in the series are recovered from the Citadel of Tales by enterprising ruin hounds, the problem becomes only more potent. But no longer! Flyknife Comics, partnering with a splinter faction of heretical Record Knights from the Citadel of Tales, have created this reference guide to help you get started in this exhilarating world of high adventure and savage danger!

In here, you'll find recaps of each of the books, as published. You'll also find that the characters' names link to handy datacards that tell you who they are, what they've done, and which books they've shown up in. Diving into the world of _The Valiant Stars_ has never been easier!

**A Note For New Readers**: While this resource may be useful as you work your way through the story, please note that it does contain **unmarked spoilers** for each book, and is written with the assumption that you have read all but the latest published book. At the current time, that is _Starbreakers -- Gunstar Runaways of the Rebel Sky Volume 2: Hypergalactic Fury Upon the Night_. We therefore recommend that if this is your first encounter with _The Valiant Stars_, you read the stories in chronological order, as they are presented in the [Librarium](/librarium).

    <strong>Summary:</strong> In their debut adventure, Snakes Leningrad and Captain Gunsmoke stage a summer music festival for the benefit of the people of Earth. Things start out a little shaky for the guys when the opening act, Robot Peter Chiykowski, doesn't go over as planned. And it all goes from bad to worse when their casual acquaintance Spooky Jim arrives with an awful single and an even worse b-side. When the boys shoot down his ambitions and revoke his backstage pass, Jim gets serious and ascends to godhood with the help of an ancient relic known only as the GodStone! Now more powerful than a large dog or several whales, Jim uses his newfound power to throw Gunsmoke and Leningrad out of the festival- and off the planet!
  </p>
  <p>As Gunsmoke, Leningrad, and RPC drift unbound through space, they float past the borders of the Kaplan Sector and wind up on the distant world of Xaxo. Taking a breather to regroup and plan, they do their best to recall how Spooky Jim got his hands on the Godstone. They remember the last time they saw it- when they stole it from Pixel City! They blasted through Rogue Cryptograms and hard encryption and busted out, only to get rolled by Commander Joachim Pegasus- the galaxy's nicest space cop- and his trusty ensign, Conrad Toast. Just when it looks like Gunsmoke and Leningrad might get a stern talking-to, all three of them get rolled by fellow Zap Jockeys and intergalactic rock superstars, Ten-Volt Tom and his band- those high-flyin', hard-jammin' astronauts, the Ancient Circumstances!</p>
  <p>Zap-Fu flies in the most classic fashion imaginable, until Gunsmoke and Tom fight each other to a standstill- Tom has the Godstone, but Gunsmoke still holds the much more powerful Prophecy Stone! Gunsmoke and Leningrad beat a snarky retreat, and then flash back to the present, just in time to realize that if Spooky Jim has the Godstone, that means Spooky Jim stole it from Tom's treasure planet- which means he has access to a dizzying array of terrifying weaponry and cool gadgets!</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, things aren't going as well for Jim as he might like- turns out, he's on Earth in search of something called the Poet's Soul, a fantastical power that will elevate him to sole master of the entire universe! But the search isn't going well, and as Jim gets more and more frustrated, Earth gets closer and closer to being eaten whole! By Jim!</p>
  <p>Back on Xaxo, the boys stumble across a black citadel, wherein shocking information is revealed to them- Xaxo is the homeworld of none other than Spooky Jim, and a fully-functional Battle Planet to boot! They fire it up, grab their gear from lockup, and get their butts in motion to take back Earth! With Pegasus and the rest of the Hercules Fleet backing them up, it seems like our guys can't lose.</p>
  <p>Like the man says, though, it ain't ever that easy! A pitched battle for the fate of Earth erupts in the night sky. Spooky Jim sends his Spooklets into the fray, and Snakes and Gunsmoke hatch a plan to get inside Spooky Jim's head and mess with his brain- literally! When Tom shows up, all bets are off, and the Poet's Soul is finally revealed- inside Robot Peter Chiykowski's heart! The gang only just barely manages to beat Spooky Jim with their legendary weaponry and legendarily good looks. Medals are handed out, the spoils are divvied up, and Spooky Jim gets sent to Space Jail to cool his heels a while. Earth, it seems, will live to jam another day!</p>

    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gunsmoke and Leningrad are back, and this time, they're on vacation! But not for long- their quiet cruise around the edge of the galaxy is interrupted when they find Vicki Vanguard and Enioch Cruel robbing an alien pyramid on the distant planet of Verde 9. The boys intervene to stop them making off with a mysterious alien relic, but their Zap-Fu isn't tenacious enough to keep the dastardly villains from making their ominous escape! Looks like vacation's cancelled for our favourite Zap Jockeys.
